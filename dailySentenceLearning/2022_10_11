It is clear that the trends of all three networks are upwards with the most striking feature being
the similarity between the National railway network and London Underground.
Starting from one billion passengers using national rail network in 1950,
this figure rose slightly to a peak of about 1.1 billion just before 1960, then dropping consistently to reach the lowest
level of 600 million in 1980.
In contrast, the number of people who used the London Underground in the 1950's was only two thirds of those taking national
railway network, with about 750 million. After this, the number remained stable for next 20 years, followed by a gradual decrease to a low of 500 million in around 1985
.However ,the next several years experienced a rapid increase in passenger numbers of London Underground to equal those using national rail way network.
There after, both followed a very similar pattern as they showed an upward trend towards the billion passenger mark until 2004.05
, with the 1980s and the early 2000s seeing the sharpest increase
On the other hand , after their introduction in the 1960s, the light railway and metro systems carried fewer passengers
than the other two networks, no more than around ten million over the first 15 years.
Nonetheless, in the 1980s, there was a marginal increase int the number of journeys made by passengers, reaching nearly 200 million in 2004/05
